### Day 1: June 5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started the Sass course and I feel excited.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding on Sass, the course is amazing but my Internet connection is not very good. Today I didn't work on algorithm from hacker rank, because I was focused on the course.


### Day 2

**Today's Progress**: I'm still doing the Sass course.

**Thoughts** I've started to code pretty hard on Sass, I've created the final project for this course although I don't wanna spoil you it's a personal web site. I didn't create a repo for this yet because I'm waiting for move more deep on the course.


### Day 3

**Today's Progress**: I decided back to Hacker Rank, so I took a break of Sass course.

**Thoughts** Today I resolve a problem about inheritance in javascript at Hacker Rank (Link bellow), I was doing the 30 days of code challenge, but for work reason I was delayed. So Today I resolved this make me win 30 point there.

### Day 4

**Today's Progress**: Working on Hacker Rank challenge.

**Thoughts** Today I resolve another problem about abstract's classes in javascript at Hacker Rank (Link bellow). Also I worked a little bit on the Sass course. I think tomorrow I gonna share the final work repo that I've worked on.

### Day 5

**Today's Progress**: linked list done!!!.

**Thoughts** Today I resolved a very difficult challenge about linked list (Link bellow) at Hacker Rank, Although it is easy I think the major problem for me was the instruction. Also reading the comments let me that understand more about the recursion, because using this way you can get another possible solution for this challenge.

### Day 6

**Today's Progress**: Awesome Sass.

**Thoughts** Today I resolved a challenge at Hacker Rank about handling exceptions, the main problem with this challenge was, I needed to use a hack to make it works with Javascript. Also I continued with the Sass course understanding the different features and the power of mixins, include and import.

### Day 7

**Today's Progress**: Break.

**Thoughts** Break.

**Link(s) to work**: Break.

### Day 8

**Today's Progress**: Continue with Sass.

**Thoughts** Continue with the Sass course, working with imports and refactor the code.

### Day 9

**Today's Progress**: Creating a custom mixins in Sass.

**Thoughts** Today I learned about create awesome mixins in Sass, in this case I created one that help me to add fonts to my app through google's font api.

### Day 10

**Today's Progress**: Creating a media queries in Sass.

**Thoughts** Today I learned about create media queries for different screen sizes.

**Link(s) to work**: Not link today :P.

### Day 11 - 12

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on functions,  more media queries, and extend other classes in Sass.

**Thoughts** Today I learned about create media queries for different screen sizes more advanced, extend functionality from other classes, and the usefull and powerfull functions.

**Link(s) to work**: Not link today :P

### Day 13

**Today's Progress**: I've learned optional classes in Sass, the percentent (extend only class) here and omit code to the pre-processor. 

**Thoughts** The functions above are important to keep your code clean, but the optional class for me, is not relevant because, when I'm not using something on the code I remove it. So we are using a control version, and there we can check the old code.

**Link(s) to work**: Not link today :P

### Day 14

**Today's Progress**: Father's days, I was off

**Thoughts** Father's days.

**Link(s) to work**: Father's days

### Day 15

**Today's Progress**: I almost finish the Sass course. 

**Thoughts** Well I arrived to the last part about Sass framework, this part is too long so I think tomorrow I can finish it. After that I will create a tribute page following everything learned on this course.

**Link(s) to work**: Not link today :P

### Day 16

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the Sass course. 

**Thoughts** Today Although I finished the course I've learned about different framework to work with Sass, for instance Compass, Susy and Breakpoint. This tools are pretty awesome because can make you save time a lot with something that are nightmares in the real css world. Also these frameworks have a lot of functions that can make you, as I said your live more easier. Breakpoint is focused on responsive design, Susy is like a bootstrap with the difference that you can customize the column that you will work with.
And Compass is an extension of Sass (as in Compass requires Sass). It has its own compiler (instead of sass --watch, you use compass watch). It has a large collection of mixins and functions that you'll find incredibly useful (while commonly pointed to for generating vendor prefixed CSS3 properties, it can do things like automatically generate spritemaps and the CSS to go with them).

### Day 17 - 18

**Today's Progress**: Welcome back React. 

**Thoughts** Ok, many month ago I started the React-Readux course but I didn't finish it, I decided to conclude. I'm on the last part of this, where I'm trying to understand the redux complex.

### Day 19

**Today's Progress**: Off Personal reasons. 

**Thoughts** Off

**Link(s) to work**: Off.

### Day 20

**Today's Progress**: Update the react project with the CRUD actions. 

**Thoughts** Well, today I learned about how to handle the CRUD on react's apps, initially react redux-flux concepts are pretty weird, but after you create an example you will understand it. Next steps on the course are, handle errors and testing on react (This is the most important part for me). Also today I thought about some projects to work, I know Free code camp or others pages offer some ideas to work, but I decided start my own ideas.

#Days 21-26

**Progress**: Finished React Course, working on other ideas to the react project, started IOS course.

**Thoughts**: Hard week, as I said I finished the react course, but the challenges are the challenges. I spent a lot time trying to moving through the react develop alone, checking my notes and back and forth. In many times I felt lost, mostly when I got an error, but I thought for a second about redux structure and I caught the error. I should add new features to this react app in the next days, but I'm splitting my day time studying IOS. I started a new course about this, so with react I will code on both.

#Days 27-30

**Progress**: Go Swift go!.

**Thoughts**: Ok, as I said in my last update, I've started a Ios/Swift course. After many years trying to learn this, finally I'm in. The course is pretty interesting, the author goes slow letting to the student follow the different instructions. the only problem that I've figured until now, is that accidentally deleted the Main Storyboard and I spent a couple of hours trying to recovery. Also I created a calculator but I haven't pushed yet to github the reason is that I will improve this.

About React, I completed the delete Author, I think I learned a lot trying to achieve this. Now I need to replicate this to Course, and try to complete others small challenges that the Course's author recommend. 

**Link(s) to work**: No link today.
